# Hybrid E-Commerce Framework

## Overview
Inspired by Rahul Shetty's Udemy course in Selenium, developed an end-to-end Hybrid Framework for an e-commerce application.

## Key Features

- **Modular Structure**: Organized into modular components like Test Scripts, Page Objects, Utilities, Test Data, and Configuration files for better organization and maintenance.

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implements POM to represent web pages as classes, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **Properties File**: Configuration parameters centralized in a properties file for easy configuration and maintenance across different environments.

- **Keyword-Driven Approach**: Utilizes a keyword-driven approach for test case execution, abstracting test steps using keywords mapped to methods in Page Object classes.

- **TestNG Integration**: Integrated with TestNG for test execution, reporting, and management, providing features like prioritization, parallel execution, and reporting.

- **Extent Reports**: Generates detailed and interactive test reports using Extent Reports, including test case status, execution time, screenshots, and logs.

## Folder Structure
- **src/:** Contains the source code for the automation framework.
- **test_scripts/:** Test scripts written in Java for test case execution.
- **page_objects/:** Page Object classes representing web pages.
- **utilities/:** Utility classes for common functionalities.
- **config/:** Configuration files for environment settings and test parameters.
- **reports/:** Directory for storing test execution reports generated by Extent Reports.
